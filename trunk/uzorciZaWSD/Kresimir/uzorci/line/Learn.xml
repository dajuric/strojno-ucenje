</sentence>
<sentence>

In order to reduce the incentive for long-distance companies to bypass the local companies through alternative distribution systems, the FCC instituted a fixed monthly subscriber  <tag key="phone"/>  charge for residential and business subscribers. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 This charge, imposed in June 1985 at $1 a month, is now $2 a month for residential subscribers and $6 a month for multiline business customers.  The charge is de signed to make subscribers pay for part of the fixed costs of the  <tag key="phone"/>  to their homes or businesses rather than adding these costs to the costs of long-distance service.

 In your May 21 story about the phone industry billing customers for unconnected calls, I was surprised that you did not discuss whether such billing is appropriate.

 There is no more reason not to pay for tying up network facilities when calls go unanswered than there is for a refund on gasoline when one drives to a store only to find that desired merchandise is out of stock.

 It's a step in the right direction, an investment banker said of the move.  A Fed spokesman said Friday that extending  <tag key="phone"/>  to investment banks is still under consideration.  Morgan Stanley  Co., Goldman, Sachs  Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. are among the investment banks that have become major foreign exchange market participants in recent years and seek lines to the Fed.  The Fed wouldn't say which or how many brokers it established links with, but two New York brokers identified themselves as having opened lines to the Fed: Noonan, Astley  Pearce Inc. and Tullett  Tokyo Forex Inc.  For the Fed, lines to brokers provide instantaneous information on exchange-rate moves.  For brokers, as for commercial banks, getting a line to the Fed brings prestige and at least the appearance of having access to the internal workings of the often secretive central bank.  If the Fed eventually chooses to use brokers for its currency transactions, the lines also could deliver sizable chunks of profitable business.

 That's because not all of those switchboards keep track of whether calls are routed long distance, so it would be difficult to add access charges to such calls.

 An important challenge facing Mr. Adams is the distressed economy of the company's regional-service territory, which has been hard hit by the drought and energy slump.  Last year, the company's telephone business had its poorest annual growth volume for new telephone  <tag key="phone"/>  since the Great Depression.  It installed only 8,100 new lines.

 The allegations are not true and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.  The suits, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, stem from claims by two fired Cincinnati Bell employees, who told local newspapers that they had been ordered to illegally tap the telephone  <tag key="phone"/>  of more than 1,000 Cincinnati area residents.

 But now, even the libertine French are cracking down.  French entrepreneurs dish out pretty much the same fare that their U.S. counterparts provide: gab  <tag key="phone"/>  that dozens of people can dial to converse in language as off-color as strikes their fancy; private lines for one-on-one dirty talking; and prerecorded sex chatter. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The French also offer something not available in the U.S.  the pink Minitel, which allows customers to send dirty messages to one another through video terminals, called Minitels, that are attached to millions of French phones.  As in the U.S., the gab  <tag key="phone"/>  have been a big money-maker. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 But, whereas in the U.S. they are extremely difficult to regulate, in France they are being banned.  France Telecom, the nation's telecommunications authority, announced last month it will abolish the gab  <tag key="phone"/>  as of October.  We realized that every one of the chat lines was pink {pornographic}, says a France Telecom official. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 He brushes aside protests from pink-telephone services that the action restricts free speech.  There isn't any law that says we have to provide chat  <tag key="phone"/> , the official says.  He estimates that the gab lines were bringing their operators at least 100 million French francs ($15.6 million) a year.  Despite the ban, French officials say their crackdown on other forms of dial-a-porn is limited by the same legal void that exists in the U.S. Nothing in French law restricts what two individuals can say over a telephone line.  Unless somebody involved can be judged guilty of inciting debauchery, the only way to prevent pornographic services is to close down an entire category of them  as France has done with the gab lines.

 If there's a loophole in your tariff you can leave it to this company to find it  quickly, says Rose Llauget, an executive at GTE Florida Inc., which runs the Tampa-area phone service.  Megaquest, meanwhile, argues that phone companies are keepers of a public utility, and shouldn't be allowed to censor what goes out over the  <tag key="phone"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 They can also choose from a variety of tapes by pushing a number on the phone. (Press 1 for the sexiest love kittens in New York. . . .  For the pain and humiliation you deserve, you gotta push 6. . . .) Or callers can choose a one-on-one  <tag key="phone"/>  like the C-Line, which recently ended its run in Houston amid growing public pressure. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Megaquest is also a big player in the clean side of the dial-it market, such as taped jokes.  But its biggest business is in the industry's hottest and most controversial new area: the gab  <tag key="phone"/> , a service that dozens of people can dial at once to talk to one another.  Gab lines bring in about 70% of Megaquest's revenue.  About three-fourths of all the 400-odd gab lines in the U.S. today are Megaquest's, Mr. Eisenberg says. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 They are easily the most slippery dial-it service to regulate.  Callers on a gab  <tag key="phone"/>  are just talking to one another on the telephone, something the phone companies and the government can't very well prohibit.  Megaquest loves to talk about the support gab lines offer the shy and the lonely, as it did in a recent case in Alabama.  Many people in Birmingham are shut-ins, people who because of a handicap, illness or old age, cannot get out of their homes frequently, the company argued in a filing before the Alabama Public Service Commission, after South Central Bell tried to stop billing for its lines. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Through group conferencing, these people can interact with other members of the community.  Ms. Superfon says a soothing Megaquest operator on a Fresno, Calif., gab  <tag key="phone"/>  once talked a deranged Vietnam veteran out of killing himself.  Actually, it's hard to imagine the aged or the suicidal getting much comfort from many of Megaquest's gab lines. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Welcome to the only X-rated party  <tag key="phone"/>  in town! blares a tape that callers hear on one line before the gabbing begins.  For a steamy sexual encounter you'll never forget, call . . . ! Another gab line calls itself the hot centerfold line and refers callers to another number where they can teach an inexperienced lady about the birds and the bees! 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Like other gab- <tag key="phone"/>  proprietors, Megaquest hires operators to monitor callers.  That is ostensibly to keep disruptive people off the lines, and to enforce the ground rules of its special teen service: no callers over 17, no cursing and no talk about drugs or sex. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Not surprisingly, the rules are loosely enforced.  On one recent afternoon on the New York teen  <tag key="phone"/> , a caller could hear Tony and Robert screaming obscenely at each other in an argument about their virility. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 One important role monitors play is to juice up conversations whenever they lag.  The monitor on Megaquest's bisexual  <tag key="phone"/>  recently got the conversation rolling by discussing the relative merits of different gender combinations. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Another job for the monitors is steering customers to Megaquest's out-and-out porn services.  One wall poster in the New York office lists a special number and adds: The most important  <tag key="phone"/> ! 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That's a number Megaquest uses for various extra-pricey, hard-core porn services.  This side of the gab  <tag key="phone"/>  is one you won't learn about in Megaquest's filings with the public-service commission. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 To a lot of parents, what Megaquest does is turn their telephones into raunchy, high-priced jukeboxes.  Cincinnati Bell started running gab  <tag key="phone"/>  last year and was stunned to see customer complaints double. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 But lawmakers and the industry are finding that writing dial-it regulations that stand up to scrutiny is as hard as nailing Jell-O to the wall.  Phone companies, as regulated common carriers, can't always simply stop doing business with  <tag key="phone"/>  they deem offensive.  Southwestern Bell tried to quit billing for gab lines by arguing that the state rules authorizing its dial-it services covered taped messages, not live talk.

 Since January, Southwestern Bell has sold about 16,000 new  <tag key="phone"/>  to current business customers by introducing them to various features of Integrated Services Digital Network, such as inspect, which displays the name and telephone number of the party calling.

 Callers are invited to play interactive games with the movie's characters, to enter sweepstakes and, of course, to run, don't walk, to the nearest theater.  Toll telephone services have mostly been the stuff of pornography  <tag key="phone"/>  and of children's horror-story and Santa Claus lines.  But movie marketers hope they can use the lines to entice potential moviegoers, especially teen-agers and young adults. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Even better from the marketer's point of view: The calls cost money, so marketers can break even or even turn a profit, in effect charging people to be subjected to advertising.  Typical of the new services is the Indiana Jones  <tag key="phone"/> , which costs $2.50 for a two-minute story.

 To combat the critics, Interactive TeleMedia, a Los Angeles-based firm specializing in 900 numbers for the entertainment business, has come up with a system to block multiple calls.

 Since then, Paramount's Star Trek V and Indiana Jones have followed, while Orion's Great Balls of Fire has experimented with a 900 number in a very limited way.

Blair's Mr. Ellman says the company is also working on a 900 line to coincide with an animated Christmas video release and a major feature film for next summer.  Still, plenty of moviemakers are steering clear of the 900 number lines, wary of the sometimes sleazy reputation of the business.

 Quaker Oats Co., in a move to reduce its swollen debt load, agreed to sell several recently acquired food  <tag key="product"/>  to Kraft Inc. for $235 million.  The businesses planned for sale, including such lines as Seven Seas salad dressings and Chiffon margarine, were all acquired last September when Quaker paid $805 million for Anderson, Clayton  Co., Houston.

 International Business Machines Corp., in another move to regain ground on competitors such as Digital Equipment Corp., unveiled four new models in its most powerful mid-range computer  <tag key="product"/>  and its first mainframe computer priced below $1 million.

 What we've really done . . . is enhanced our mid-range, said Larry Ford, an IBM vice president.  Mr. Ford said that since last October, We've completely refreshed the entire mainframe  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Mr. Ford said that since last October, We've completely refreshed the entire mainframe  <tag key="product"/> .  However, the machines aren't likely to significantly contribute to IBM's sales until the fourth quarter; the new mainframe, the 3090 model 120, won't be available until October, while the new machines in IBM's 4381 medium-sized line are scheduled to be shipped in the first quarter of 1988. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The four new 4381 computers are priced between $225,000 and $890,000.  The most potent of the four, the model 24, is at least six times more powerful than the entry level offering in the eight-model  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Under the plan, customers would get a current 4381 model and by the first quarter next year receive accessories that convert the machines into the more powerful models.  IBM offered a similar incentive plan to boost current sales of an unavailable product earlier this year, when it unveiled two new models in its 3090, or Sierra mainframe  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Many of IBM's 4381 customers, mid-sized businesses or departments within large companies, have reached the limit of the memory capacity of the current models, but aren't ready to buy a mainframe yet, he added.  The 4381 announcements also put to rest speculation that IBM would quickly obsolete the 4381  <tag key="product"/>  with the 9370 mid-size line that was unveiled last October, said David Andrews, a consultant with ADM Inc. of Cheshire, Conn. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The new mainframe brings the 3090 down one more level, said IBM's Mr. Ford.  IBM also announced new software packages, including the first software permitting the development of applications that will run across the so-called System/370  <tag key="product"/>  of computers.  The System/370 line consists of the 9370 and 4381 mid-range computers and the 3090 mainframes.

 Yesterday's hardware and software introductions are the most recent step in a flurry of moves IBM has made since October to fend off stiff competition from companies such as Digital Equipment, a major threat in the mid-range market, and Amdahl Corp., which makes machines that run software made for IBM's mainframes.  In addition to unveiling the 9370  <tag key="product"/> , IBM has enhanced its lackluster workstation, the RT personal computer, and cut prices on its mainframe offerings while introducing new ones.  The company also introduced a new line of personal computers last month, in a bid to protect its position in that market.

 IBM and Apple are making big cuts in the number of dealers who will be permitted to carry their new products, but are trying to tie up more of the remaining dealers' shelf space and more of their salesmens' mind space  as one dealer puts it.

 The toy maker also decided to aim the doll at little girls; thus, all but one of the original story's male characters were changed to females.

 The complaint alleges that Guinness forced Renfield to be acquired by Mr. Riklis, who controls Schenley.  The suit says Guinness did this to pay Mr. Riklis back for his purported assistance during Guinness's 1986 takeover of Distillers Co.

 Early this year, analysts feared that International Business Machines' increased competitiveness could blunt Digital's success.

 For manufacturers, the biggest challenge is coping with the short shelf life of refrigerated products.  No national food processor yet has introduced a successful  <tag key="product"/>  of new refrigerated entrees and a lot of money has been spent, says John Luther, a Marketing Corporation of America official.  Last month, in fact, Campbell Soup withdrew its Fresh Chef line of refrigerated soups, sauces and salads from national distribution. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Another is what he terms a sell-out strategy, making sure products are sold by a certain date through couponing and other inducements.  (Using the lessons learned from Fresh Chef and an earlier group of refrigerated entrees that never emerged from test market, Campbell says it now is testing a new  <tag key="product"/>  of refrigerated entrees and side dishes).

</sentence>
<sentence>
 As a result, Mr. Jager says, a small business can look at a situation and say, 'Not only is the climate more favorable for me to take on a big infringer, but the chances for a higher return are greater than they used to be.'  In its suit, Manhattan Toy doesn't ask for specific damages, only an amount equal to the profits Gerber has made on its dinosaur  <tag key="product"/> .

 The Premier is the first car for the Jeep/Eagle division following the purchase of AMC last summer.  Jeep is a solidly successful franchise that appeals to the kind of buyers Chrysler wants, but the Eagle car  <tag key="product"/>  is a decidedly weak sister.

 Broadway Jeep/Eagle in Denver, Colo., for example, sells about 3,000 new Jeeps a year, but less than 300 cars.  We don't really have much of a car  <tag key="product"/>  anymore, laments Steve Segal, the dealership's general manager. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Indeed, Jeep customers have long disdained the cars offered by AMC and Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, the French auto maker that owned more than 40% of AMC before the Chrysler purchase.  Now the Eagle car  <tag key="product"/>  consists mainly of leftover Renault models and the discontinued AMC Eagle four-wheel-drive car.

 Chrysler also decided not to go ahead with plans for a coupe version, in part because the coupe, without a lot of work, wouldn't have met the standards Chrysler has set for the division, company officials said.

 Its array of consumer products is compatible with E-II's lineup, which includes Samsonite luggage and Stiffel lamps.

<sentence>
 He's more inclined to buy and sell companies than to run them for very long.

 This could be a terrific opportunity for good value, mid-priced brands to reassert themselves, says Nancy Posternak, managing director of strategic services at Thompson.

 C. Olivetti  Co., the Italian computer maker, is bracing for trouble following the stock-market crash, but company executives said they remain optimistic about a revival of sagging profits next year.  To speed its expected comeback, Europe's second-biggest maker of personal computers yesterday introduced a  <tag key="product"/>  of powerful minicomputers and a new marketing strategy designed to increase its slipping share of world computer sales. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Analysts predict net income will fall as much as a third this year, from 565.5 billion lire in 1986.  One problem has been flat sales of Olivetti's five-year-old  <tag key="product"/>  of minicomputers.  The new line of minicomputers shown yesterday seeks to boost Olivetti's minicomputer sales by 50% annually over the next two years, Mr. Levi said.

<sentence>
 Kaypro Corp., which entered the computer sales market in 1982 with a  <tag key="product"/>  of transportable computers, said it discontinued the line, and partly as a result, the computer products concern posted a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss.  Kaypro said the line of transportables, which are larger and bulkier than portable machines, was dropped because of competitive pressures and the amount of sales effort required to promote it.  The line accounted for only about 5% of Kaypro's sales of $105.6 million for the fiscal year ended Aug. 28, a company spokeswoman said. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Kaypro shares closed at $1.0625, down 0.1875 cents.  Sales of the Kaypro transportable  <tag key="product"/>  have dwindled in recent years, as smaller, lighter-weight laptop computers have gained popularity. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Kaypro has focused lately on other computer products, and in 1985 introduced its personal computer that is compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s PC AT, marketing it primarily to small businesses and professionals.  Andrew F. Kay, Kaypro chairman, said eliminating the transportable  <tag key="product"/>  would allow the company to concentrate on marketing of a smaller group of mainstream technology computers.

 Olivetti, Europe's second-largest supplier of personal computers, was trying to convince everybody that whatever IBM {International Business Machines Corp., the first-ranking supplier} can do, they can do better, recalls customer John Heaps, deputy general manager of Britannia Building Society, a British thrift institution.  The Olivetti sales pitch succeeded: A few weeks later, Britannia spent #4 million ($7.2 million) on a new  <tag key="product"/>  of Olivetti personal computers for its tellers.

 The most powerful model  which Olivetti bought from Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Edge Computer Corp.  crunches numbers about four times faster than Olivetti's existing  <tag key="product"/>  1 minicomputers.  The Edge model is expected to cost more than twice the 50 million lire of Olivetti's top-priced mini in its current line. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Among other things, analysts say, it risks confusing customers and dealers because its  <tag key="product"/>  2 machines also may compete with minicomputers it already markets in Europe for ATT.  The expected unveiling of the new minicomputer line, along with September's introduction of a line of new Olivetti personal computers, seems to correct one of Olivetti's biggest problems this year.

</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, kids will be itchy to spend holiday gift money and will probably have a few presents they want to exchange as well.  Robert Lurie, Tyco's vice president of advertising, says the post-Christmas introduction of the Dino-Riders  <tag key="product"/>  is primarily a marketing decision, but he concedes that production delays also influenced the timing.  About two-thirds of the line could have been ready for Christmas, he says, but if we had hurried it, the quality and authenticity of the dinosaurs might not have been as good.

 Compaq Computer's chairman, Benjamin Rosen, recalls an analyst's blunt report the day after International Business Machines introduced a spiffy new  <tag key="product"/>  of computers in April. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 One of the most important things driving the (stock) price up is Compaq's ability to increase the average selling price (of their computers) ahead of the industry, says Michael Geran, an E.F. Hutton analyst.  Also, some say Compaq is benefiting from IBM's discontinuation of most of its old  <tag key="product"/>  of personal computers.  Compaq still makes machines compatible with IBM's old line, and IBM's move has forced the world to go out and sample the other guy's product, says Daniel Benton, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Software to take full advantage of the hardware IBM introduced in April won't be available until 1988 and later.

 While many companies usually see a 25% increase in revenue each September, he believes the increase this year could be about 35% and even as high as 40% in some cases.

 A Marks  Spencer spokesman said the major reason is Coloroll's involvement in its own shops, apparently referring to a showcase retail outlet Coloroll opened this year on London's expensive Regent Street, as well as Coloroll's relations with other retailers.

 Most users are starting to recognize that despite the hype, the . . . (new IBM  <tag key="product"/> ) offers no significant performance advantages over competitors (and) costs a lot more than most of them, William F. Zachmann, an analyst at International Data Corp., wrote recently in InfoWorld, a trade publication.

 Much of the software that will take advantage of the Micro Channel won't be available at least until 1989, and the only way to truly test a copy is to run the new software on it.

 The new pathway clears some of the bottlenecks of the pathway in other Compaq computers, which are based on the design set by International Business Machines Corp. with its IBM PC in 1981.

 Many schools and companies make such purchases easier these days by selling new machines to students or employees and passing along volume discounts of 25% to 45% that they get from the manufacturer.

 In general, industry executives, analysts and members of user groups say someone who wants business software will want to look at IBM-compatible machines, and particularly at Tandy models introduced last month.  A consumer who doesn't know computer basics and wants a machine that's especially easy to use may want to look at the Apple  <tag key="product"/> , including one of the Macintoshes introduced in March. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That's hundreds of dollars less than an actual IBM XT and only slightly more than most comparable no-name clones.  IBM has stopped producing PC XTs as part of a bid to get the world to shift to the  <tag key="product"/>  it introduced in April. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 But the risk of machines compatible with the XT becoming orphans appears small.  XT-compatible computers can run all existing software for IBM-compatible machines and can be upgraded to run software written for an operating system that Microsoft Corp. is close to shipping for the new IBM  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 For someone seeking more power  to handle a spreadsheet or a big data base, for example  many specialists recommend Tandy's 1000 TX.  This computer is compatible with the PC AT, which represented the high end of IBM's old personal-computer  <tag key="product"/> .

 But the Compaq and IBM machines respond more to the needs of business than of home users.  The IBM  <tag key="product"/> , for instance, is designed to make it easier to link personal computers with each other and with a mainframe  hardly an issue in the home. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 In any case, the benefits of the IBM and Compaq computers carry a hefty price: The machines cost several hundred dollars to $1,000 more than the Tandy 1000 TX.  The performance of all the machines is pretty much the same, and the average consumer doesn't need the architecture of the new IBM  <tag key="product"/> , says Michele Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.

 Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to introduce next week speedier versions of its top-of-the- <tag key="product"/>  portable and desktop computers.

 It'll give (the Compaq entries) the amazing graphics that have so far been available only on workstations.  And it should be better even than the improved graphics on the new IBM  <tag key="product"/> , the source said.

 It's the first time you'll have a (personal computer) with workstation power.  While Compaq is improving its graphics to match advances made by IBM in its April  <tag key="product"/> , sources said the Compaq models won't mimic the most important change in the new IBM computer  the microchannel, IBM's term for the pathway between the parts of the computer that actually perform computations and other parts like the memory, storage, modems and printers. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 In doing so next week, Compaq will be directly challenging IBM's new  <tag key="product"/>  in the big business market.  That is a sign of Compaq's belief that buyers still aren't completely enamored of the new IBM line, and also, perhaps, that the new IBM computers are proving more difficult to copy both technically and legally than the old line.

 Beyond scoring points in that public-image battle, IBM's new  <tag key="product"/> , the 3090 Model S, is intended to give customers the improvements in price and performance they expect every couple of years.  The Armonk, N.Y., company last overhauled its mainframe line in January 1987.

 The 1988 Taurus and Sable models aren't affected because their gas tanks are of a different design, the spokesman said.  This is the latest in a series of quality embarrassments to hit the Taurus-Sable  <tag key="product"/> , launched in the 1986 model year. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Last summer, the Taurus and Sable models were included in a recall of 4.3 million Ford vehicles to correct fuel- <tag key="product"/>  defects linked to 230 engine fires.  Ford has conducted five other safety-related recalls affecting smaller numbers of the Taurus and Sable line, as well as four recalls to fix problems not related to safety, a company spokesman said.

 Retailers thought the change  to bolder colors, busier patterns and higher prices  too much for the Arrow man.  For the most part, they rejected the new sport shirt  <tag key="product"/> , forcing Cluett to unload much of it to discounters at fire-sale prices. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That lowered West Point's net income from continuing operations to $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from $11.6 million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.  Cluett had transformed much of its normally classic, plain-vanilla, mid-priced  <tag key="product"/>  of sport shirts into threads it hoped would draw a younger, more affluent buyer.  Normally safe shades of blues, browns and grays became more vibrant, and the spring line of Arrow sport shirts included a mix of bolder primary colors, busy stripes and multi-colored madras. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, in the confusion following the takeover, the designers became isolated not only from Arrow customers but also from the company's own sales staff.  Last spring and summer, as they were creating the bolder spring  <tag key="product"/> , the designers failed to notice that both retailers and consumers were becoming more conservative. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That shift intensified after last October's stock market crash.  Cluett seemed to have had the  <tag key="product"/>  misstriped and miscolored, says an executive at a rival, who credits Cluett's mistake for a 15% to 20% rise in his own sales. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, say Cluett executives, the designers skimped on quality.  For one thing, the higher-priced shirts in the  <tag key="product"/>  didn't look much different from their less-expensive counterparts, says Harold Streitman, Cluett's new design director for sportswear. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 And managers are on the lookout for niche markets.  An example: Cluett is talking about developing for the first time a  <tag key="product"/>  of shirts to be sold only in California and Florida.

 But many doubt it can beat out four Japanese rivals, who control the market.  Moreover, since Mr. McGovern took over, the company has cranked out hundreds of new products and  <tag key="product"/>  extensions to cut its reliance on soup, which provides 30% of sales.

 Sales, which plummeted to $8 million last year from nearly $35 million in 1984, are expected to hit $12 million this year and more than $20 million in 1989.  Less than a year ago, Mr. Kramer was importing about 60% of his  <tag key="product"/>  to survive and bracing for the end.

 The payoffs from this level of investment were obvious last year with Attack  an enzymatic, concentrated laundry detergent that took Japan by storm, coming out of nowhere to give Kao a 40.5% share of Japan's detergent market, up 7.1 percentage points from the year before.  The focus on RD is similarly trumpeted with Kao's Biore  <tag key="product"/>  of skin ceams and its Sofina cosmetics, both of which are expected to be broadly marketed in the U.S. eventually. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Whether or not Kao's products actually represent scientific breakthroughs, the company has been able to successfully market them in Japan by sheer weight of advertising dollars.  According to Tokyo-based Dentsu Inc., the world's biggest ad agency, Kao spent 35.4 billion yen on advertising in its last fiscal year, putting it ahead of Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Lion Corp., Kao's major competitor in some  <tag key="product"/> .

 And IBM's 9370 minicomputer  <tag key="product"/> , its initial attempt to regain dominance, has failed to become the Vax killer that IBM proclaimed at its introduction more than 1 1/2 years ago.  Because of the stakes, IBM's introduction is the biggest the computer industry has seen in the 14 months since IBM brought out its PS/2 personal-computer line  and some say it's the biggest announcement since IBM introduced its original PC in 1981.

 IBM underscored the significance by bringing together 170,000 people yesterday to hear the news at more than 200 locations around the world.  The new IBM  <tag key="product"/>  (code-named Silverlake in recent months but now called the Application System/400) merges the IBM System 36 and System 38 machines.

 Last fall, the cosmetics maker launched a marketing initiative dubbed The Nines, designed to boost its visibility in tony department stores.  Over the years, Revlon had acquired prestige cosmetics  <tag key="product"/>  such as Charles of the Ritz and Princess Marcella Borghese, but had no comprehensive marketing strategy for them.  Under the Nines program, the company gathered all nine of its upscale cosmetics lines  encompassing some 3,000 items  at a single cosmetics counter with a special Nines banner. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Competitors say Revlon's sales staff was unable to master the vast array of products they were expected to push.  And the attempt to sell customers more than one cosmetics  <tag key="product"/>  per visit undermined efforts to build brand loyalty.  Consumers buy different pieces from different lines, said a marketing executive at one competitor. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Adding to Revlon's difficulties, the company claims that 200 retailers nationwide grew impatient with the pace of the rollout and implemented their own version of the Nines.  These independent-minded retailers lumped together all of Revlon's  <tag key="product"/> , without waiting for marketing support from headquarters or proper training for their sales help.

 But the mess in sales isn't the only problem that slowed revenue growth into single digits in the latest quarter.  In a costly gamble, Digital decided last year to cancel a major computer design, leaving big customers without a replacement at the high end of its  <tag key="product"/> .

 Like many competitors, Digital was caught off guard by the clamor for standard software.

 So the Japan of the 21st century may be expected to assume the role of a mature creditor country, importing more than it is exporting, and earning more from its foreign asset holdings than it is investing abroad to add to them.

 Ms. Ellerbee also reports that she spun around and warned the woman she was going to steal that.  This is, needless to say, not exactly the same as appropriating a  <tag key="text"/>  and then delivering it in tones brimful of the pride of authorship  in a keynote address.  Ms. Ellerbee learned in advance that Ms. Richards was planning to use the line, whereupon she inquired as to whether Ms. Richards was planning to cite the source.

 After all, if Ann Richards and Co. had been old-fashioned enough to say, As Linda Ellerbee tells us or even as I heard in a lecture somewhere, why then the New York Times columnist and a great many other citizens probably wouldn't have gone around talking about the formidable wit and wisdom of Ann Richards.

Presidential contender Goldwater would have been a lot better off in 1964 if he had only seen fit to credit the real author of what turned out to be the most self-destructive lines ever uttered in a campaign speech: I would remind you . . . extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.

 Indeed, his strategy seems to be not to say very much at all about foreign policy.

 But Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a rival for the Democratic nomination, once charged that the Massachusetts governor's foreign policy experience was limited to negotiating with New Hampshire Gov.

 According to a new study by Michael Cunningham, a University of Louisville psychologist, the magic formula is a simple Hi, followed by something equally innocuous, such as What do you think of the band?
