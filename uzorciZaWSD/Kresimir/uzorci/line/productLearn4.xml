 International Business Machines Corp., in another move to regain ground on competitors such as Digital Equipment Corp., unveiled four new models in its most powerful mid-range computer  <tag key="product"/>  and its first mainframe computer priced below $1 million. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 "What we've really done . . . is enhanced our mid-range," said Larry Ford, an IBM vice president.  Mr. Ford said that since last October, "We've completely refreshed the entire mainframe  <tag key="product"/> ." 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Mr. Ford said that since last October, "We've completely refreshed the entire mainframe  <tag key="product"/> ."  However, the machines aren't likely to significantly contribute to IBM's sales until the fourth quarter; the new mainframe, the 3090 model 120, won't be available until October, while the new machines in IBM's 4381 medium-sized line are scheduled to be shipped in the first quarter of 1988. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The four new 4381 computers are priced between $225,000 and $890,000.  The most potent of the four, the model 24, is at least six times more powerful than the entry level offering in the eight-model  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Under the plan, customers would get a current 4381 model and by the first quarter next year receive accessories that convert the machines into the more powerful models.  IBM offered a similar incentive plan to boost current sales of an unavailable product earlier this year, when it unveiled two new models in its 3090, or Sierra mainframe  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Many of IBM's 4381 customers, mid-sized businesses or departments within large companies, have reached the limit of the memory capacity of the current models, but aren't ready to buy a mainframe yet, he added.  The 4381 announcements also put to rest speculation that IBM would "quickly obsolete the 4381  <tag key="product"/> " with the 9370 mid-size line that was unveiled last October, said David Andrews, a consultant with ADM Inc. of Cheshire, Conn. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The new mainframe "brings the 3090 down one more level," said IBM's Mr. Ford.  IBM also announced new software packages, including the first software permitting the development of applications that will run across the so-called System/370  <tag key="product"/>  of computers.  The System/370 line consists of the 9370 and 4381 mid-range computers and the 3090 mainframes.

 For manufacturers, the biggest challenge is coping with the short shelf life of refrigerated products.  "No national food processor yet has introduced a successful  <tag key="product"/>  of new refrigerated entrees and a lot of money has been spent," says John Luther, a Marketing Corporation of America official.  Last month, in fact, Campbell Soup withdrew its Fresh Chef line of refrigerated soups, sauces and salads from national distribution. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Another is what he terms a "sell-out strategy," making sure products are sold by a certain date through couponing and other inducements.

 The Premier is the first car for the Jeep/Eagle division following the purchase of AMC last summer.  Jeep is a solidly successful franchise that appeals to the kind of buyers Chrysler wants, but the Eagle car  <tag key="product"/>  is a decidedly weak sister.

 Broadway Jeep/Eagle in Denver, Colo., for example, sells about 3,000 new Jeeps a year, but less than 300 cars.  "We don't really have much of a car  <tag key="product"/>  anymore," laments Steve Segal, the dealership's general manager.

 Chrysler also decided not to go ahead with plans for a coupe version, in part because the coupe, without a lot of work, wouldn't have met the standards Chrysler has set for the division, company officials said.

 Competition has become so heated that BMW of North America Inc., a unit of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, recently announced sales incentives to help trim excess inventory  a rare move for the two West German luxury-car makers.  Toyota hopes its upscale  <tag key="product"/>  will help it hang on to current customers who have had to look elsewhere when trading up to luxury cars, and says it isn't worried about the crowded market. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 It said the dealers, who will be picked from inside and outside Toyota's current rank of 1,085 U.S. dealers, will be situated in the top 50 markets in the U.S.  markets that can sustain sales of luxury cars  and will have to demonstrate a record of customer satisfaction.  The auto maker plans to require this first group of dealers to have facilities for the Lexus cars totally separate from their current car  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That strategy is common for auto makers setting up separate dealer networks and is meant, among other things, to make buyers of the upscale cars feel special and to underscore the exclusive ambiance of the luxury market.  But some dealers have voiced skepticism about the practice, noting that sales of new luxury-car  <tag key="product"/>  may not be big enough to support the expense  often millions of dollars  of separate facilities.

 C.

</sentence>
<sentence>

<sentence>
 Kaypro Corp., which entered the computer sales market in 1982 with a  <tag key="product"/>  of transportable computers, said it discontinued the line, and partly as a result, the computer products concern posted a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss.  Kaypro said the line of transportables, which are larger and bulkier than portable machines, was dropped because of "competitive pressures and the amount of sales effort" required to promote it.  The line accounted for only about 5% of Kaypro's sales of $105.6 million for the fiscal year ended Aug. 28, a company spokeswoman said. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Kaypro shares closed at $1.0625, down 0.1875 cents.  Sales of the Kaypro transportable  <tag key="product"/>  have dwindled in recent years, as smaller, lighter-weight laptop computers have gained popularity. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Kaypro has focused lately on other computer products, and in 1985 introduced its personal computer that is compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s PC AT, marketing it primarily to small businesses and professionals.  Andrew F. Kay, Kaypro chairman, said eliminating the transportable  <tag key="product"/>  would allow the company to concentrate on marketing of "a smaller group of mainstream technology computers."

 Olivetti, Europe's second-largest supplier of personal computers, was "trying to convince everybody that whatever IBM {International Business Machines Corp., the first-ranking supplier} can do, they can do better," recalls customer John Heaps, deputy general manager of Britannia Building Society, a British thrift institution.  The Olivetti sales pitch succeeded: A few weeks later, Britannia spent #4 million ($7.2 million) on a new  <tag key="product"/>  of Olivetti personal computers for its tellers. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 The most powerful model  which Olivetti bought from Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Edge Computer Corp.  crunches numbers about four times faster than Olivetti's existing " <tag key="product"/>  1" minicomputers.  The Edge model is expected to cost more than twice the 50 million lire of Olivetti's top-priced mini in its current line. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Among other things, analysts say, it risks confusing customers and dealers because its  <tag key="product"/>  2 machines also may compete with minicomputers it already markets in Europe for AT&T.  The expected unveiling of the new minicomputer line, along with September's introduction of a line of new Olivetti personal computers, seems to correct one of Olivetti's biggest problems this year.

</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, kids will be itchy to spend holiday gift money and will probably have a few presents they want to exchange as well.  Robert Lurie, Tyco's vice president of advertising, says the post-Christmas introduction of the Dino-Riders  <tag key="product"/>  is primarily a marketing decision, but he concedes that production delays also influenced the timing.  "About two-thirds of the line could have been ready for Christmas," he says, "but if we had hurried it, the quality and authenticity of the dinosaurs might not have been as good."

 In 1986, IBM's fourth-quarter earnings dropped 48% to $1.39 billion, or $2.28 a share.

 Compaq Computer's chairman, Benjamin Rosen, recalls an analyst's blunt report the day after International Business Machines introduced a spiffy new  <tag key="product"/>  of computers in April. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 "One of the most important things driving the (stock) price up is Compaq's ability to increase the average selling price (of their computers) ahead of the industry," says Michael Geran, an E.F. Hutton analyst.  Also, some say Compaq is benefiting from IBM's discontinuation of most of its old  <tag key="product"/>  of personal computers.  Compaq still makes machines compatible with IBM's old line, and IBM's move has "forced the world to go out and sample the other guy's product," says Daniel Benton, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Software to take full advantage of the hardware IBM introduced in April won't be available until 1988 and later.

 While many companies usually see a 25% increase in revenue each September, he believes the increase this year could be about 35% and even as high as 40% in some cases.

 The new pathway clears some of the bottlenecks of the pathway in other Compaq computers, which are based on the design set by International Business Machines Corp. with its IBM PC in 1981.

 Many schools and companies make such purchases easier these days by selling new machines to students or employees and passing along volume discounts of 25% to 45% that they get from the manufacturer.

 In general, industry executives, analysts and members of user groups say someone who wants business software will want to look at IBM-compatible machines, and particularly at Tandy models introduced last month.  A consumer who doesn't know computer basics and wants a machine that's especially easy to use may want to look at the Apple  <tag key="product"/> , including one of the Macintoshes introduced in March. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That's hundreds of dollars less than an actual IBM XT and only slightly more than most comparable no-name clones.  IBM has stopped producing PC XTs as part of a bid to get the world to shift to the  <tag key="product"/>  it introduced in April. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 But the risk of machines compatible with the XT becoming orphans appears small.  XT-compatible computers can run all existing software for IBM-compatible machines and can be upgraded to run software written for an operating system that Microsoft Corp. is close to shipping for the new IBM  <tag key="product"/> . 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 For someone seeking more power  to handle a spreadsheet or a big data base, for example  many specialists recommend Tandy's 1000 TX.  This computer is compatible with the PC AT, which represented the high end of IBM's old personal-computer  <tag key="product"/> .

<sentence>
 In any case, the benefits of the IBM and Compaq computers carry a hefty price: The machines cost several hundred dollars to $1,000 more than the Tandy 1000 TX.  "The performance of all the machines is pretty much the same, and the average consumer doesn't need the architecture of the new IBM  <tag key="product"/> ," says Michele Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.

 Sales for the period jumped to $164.6 million from $70.7 million a year ago.

 Even with the U.S. action, though, industry officials say shortages of the chips are likely to continue because current production capacity is insufficient to meet an unanticipated surge in U.S. demand for the advanced chips.  On the supply side, the shortages are caused mainly by quality-control problems encountered by Japan's NEC Corp. on its new DRAM  <tag key="product"/>  and Hitachi Ltd.'s slow recovery from an earthquake in Japan that damaged one of its chip plants.

 Executives at K mart Corp. were surprised last year when Martha Stewart, an author of books on lavish cooking and entertaining, showed them she could set an elegant table from items sold at the company's discount stores.  "We couldn't believe it was our merchandise," recalls Michael Wellman, the company's vice president of marketing, who is now working with Mrs. Stewart to develop an exclusive  <tag key="product"/>  of household goods for K mart.

 Mr. Antonini says the company suffered from a "malaise" because it had expanded so much that its "growth opportunities might appear to be limited."  Mr. Antonini, who revitalized the company's apparel operations by introducing the Jaclyn Smith  <tag key="product"/>  in 1985, is trying to change that, partly by enlarging K mart stores and playing catch-up in computerization.

 The plan to test as many as 40 McKids specialty stores in shopping malls over the next two years is part of a broader effort by Sears to revitalize its sagging retailing operations.  The McKids stores will carry national brands as well as an exclusive  <tag key="product"/>  of McKids clothing and toys. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Prices will be in the "moderate" to "upper moderate" range, the spokesman said.  The McKids store concept is an outgrowth of Sears's successful arrangement with Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's to license a McKids clothing  <tag key="product"/>  now sold in 750 of its 821 Sears stores.  The line, which was introduced in 1987, is expected to generate sales of $175 million this year.

 IBM raised prices on such products as operating-system software, which controls the basic operations of a computer, and on big disk drives, which store data for mainframes and big minicomputers.

 No one, however, is predicting a resurgence in generic foods  the plain-labeled, cut-rate products that took over aisles of space in some supermarkets during the inflation-ridden 1970s.  While such  <tag key="product"/>  will continue to be offered in relatively small sections of most stores, consultants expect that consumers will instead be looking to an increased number of low-priced name brands and house brands  products that are cheaper than heavily advertised top brands but seem to offer comparable quality.

 Beyond scoring points in that public-image battle, IBM's new  <tag key="product"/> , the 3090 Model S, is intended to give customers the improvements in price and performance they expect every couple of years.  The Armonk, N.Y., company last overhauled its mainframe line in January 1987.

 The 1988 Taurus and Sable models aren't affected because their gas tanks are of a different design, the spokesman said.  This is the latest in a series of quality embarrassments to hit the Taurus-Sable  <tag key="product"/> , launched in the 1986 model year. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Last summer, the Taurus and Sable models were included in a recall of 4.3 million Ford vehicles to correct fuel- <tag key="product"/>  defects linked to 230 engine fires.  Ford has conducted five other safety-related recalls affecting smaller numbers of the Taurus and Sable line, as well as four recalls to fix problems not related to safety, a company spokesman said.

 Retailers thought the change  to bolder colors, busier patterns and higher prices  too much for the Arrow man.  For the most part, they rejected the new sport shirt  <tag key="product"/> , forcing Cluett to unload much of it to discounters at fire-sale prices. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That lowered West Point's net income from continuing operations to $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from $11.6 million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.  Cluett had transformed much of its normally classic, plain-vanilla, mid-priced  <tag key="product"/>  of sport shirts into threads it hoped would draw a younger, more affluent buyer.  Normally safe shades of blues, browns and grays became more vibrant, and the spring line of Arrow sport shirts included a mix of bolder primary colors, busy stripes and multi-colored madras. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, in the confusion following the takeover, the designers became isolated not only from Arrow customers but also from the company's own sales staff.  Last spring and summer, as they were creating the bolder spring  <tag key="product"/> , the designers failed to notice that both retailers and consumers were becoming more conservative. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 That shift intensified after last October's stock market crash.  Cluett "seemed to have had the  <tag key="product"/>  misstriped and miscolored," says an executive at a rival, who credits Cluett's mistake for a 15% to 20% rise in his own sales. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Moreover, say Cluett executives, the designers skimped on quality.  For one thing, the higher-priced shirts in the  <tag key="product"/>  didn't look much different from their less-expensive counterparts, says Harold Streitman, Cluett's new design director for sportswear. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 And managers are on the lookout for niche markets.  An example: Cluett is talking about developing for the first time a  <tag key="product"/>  of shirts to be sold only in California and Florida.

 But many doubt it can beat out four Japanese rivals, who control the market.  Moreover, since Mr. McGovern took over, the company has cranked out hundreds of new products and  <tag key="product"/>  extensions to cut its reliance on soup, which provides 30% of sales.

 The payoffs from this level of investment were obvious last year with Attack  an "enzymatic," concentrated laundry detergent that took Japan by storm, coming out of nowhere to give Kao a 40.5% share of Japan's detergent market, up 7.1 percentage points from the year before.

 Whether or not Kao's products actually represent scientific breakthroughs, the company has been able to successfully market them in Japan by sheer weight of advertising dollars.

 International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass., says IBM's share of the $16 billion market fell to 27.6% world-wide in 1987 from 29% in 1983, while the share captured by archrival Digital Equipment Corp.'s Vaxes rose to 21.6% from 13.5%.

 And IBM's 9370 minicomputer  <tag key="product"/> , its initial attempt to regain dominance, has failed to become the "Vax killer" that IBM proclaimed at its introduction more than 1 1/2 years ago.  Because of the stakes, IBM's introduction is the biggest the computer industry has seen in the 14 months since IBM brought out its PS/2 personal-computer line  and some say it's the biggest announcement since IBM introduced its original PC in 1981. 
</sentence>

 IBM underscored the significance by bringing together 170,000 people yesterday to hear the news at more than 200 locations around the world.  The new IBM  <tag key="product"/>  (code-named Silverlake in recent months but now called the Application System/400) merges the IBM System 36 and System 38 machines.  Doing so removes the incompatibilities between two of the three major minicomputer lines that IBM sells and gives IBM some relief from Digital's relentless focus on its own freedom from compatibility problems.

 The operation was in place in case IBM ended up being forced to sell off part of its business.  The System 38, in particular, was orphaned by IBM, drawing little support from the company even though its design was thought to be so sophisticated that IBM once considered using it to build a  <tag key="product"/>  of mainframes that would supersede those now on the market.

In addition, the move reintroduces the prospect of messy litigation in the personal-computer market at a time when IBM's decision to license the patents for its PS/2 line had been quieting that talk.

 C. Olivetti & Co. Mr. Cassoni's last official act as AT&T's computer chief was to give a speech promoting AT&T's Unix operating system at an industry conference here.  Because AT&T has acknowledged that software and services will command higher profit margins in the future than manufactured hardware, a number of analysts have speculated that AT&T may contract out the manufacture of its next  <tag key="product"/>  of minicomputers. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Mr. Kavner said a number of customers have been concerned about AT&T ending manufacture of computers, a move that analysts believe would cause AT&T to take another writedown.  Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said however that because most of AT&T's minicomputer sales are to the Bell operating companies, outsourcing manufacture of AT&T's next  <tag key="product"/>  of minicomputers wouldn't result in a write-down. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Mr. Kavner said the companies are most interested in sharing product-development efforts as well as helping each other in their respective markets.

 But Pontiac officials also conceded that they expect sales of their primary midsized car  <tag key="product"/> , the Pontiac Grand Prix, won't be enough to assure that the GM plant exclusively dedicated to the model will work at full capacity in the 1990 model year.  Pontiac's modest expectations for the Grand Prix, one of four lines GM designed as part of its $5 billion GM-10 midsized car program, is another sign that despite the recent announcement that the company will indefinitely idle a plant in Lakewood, Ga., GM has a long way to go to solve its costly overcapacity problem.

 Last fall, the cosmetics maker launched a marketing initiative dubbed "The Nines," designed to boost its visibility in tony department stores.  Over the years, Revlon had acquired prestige cosmetics  <tag key="product"/>  such as Charles of the Ritz and Princess Marcella Borghese, but had no comprehensive marketing strategy for them.  Under the Nines program, the company gathered all nine of its upscale cosmetics lines  encompassing some 3,000 items  at a single cosmetics counter with a special Nines banner. 
</sentence>
<sentence>
 Competitors say Revlon's sales staff was unable to master the vast array of products they were expected to push.

"Consumers buy different pieces from different lines," said a marketing executive at one competitor.

 Adding to Revlon's difficulties, the company claims that 200 retailers nationwide grew impatient with the pace of the rollout and implemented their own version of the Nines.

 Like many competitors, Digital was caught off guard by the clamor for standard software.
